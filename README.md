# Milestone-Project-Baseball
<!--
    The purpose of this project is to create a miniature baseball simulation that encapsulates one pivotal at-bat and provides the player with a psuedo-randomly-generated win or lose outcome. This will be accomplished using many different skills learned in the first unit of the Software Development Bootcamp.
    The player's agency in the game comes two-fold: they will have the option to name their team whatever they choose and they will also commit a number guess that will partially determine how the game ends. 
    For part one, initial pieces of the project will include:
-creating an HTML framework in which the game will reside
-styling said framework to give the game life
-creating a form for the player to input their team name
    (after initial testing, I needed to also include a rules section so the player knows what is going on)
-creating a "scorebug" that will automatically update when the player has submitted their team name
    Part two will consist of giving the player to chance to submit a number guess and using that guess plus a randomly-generated second number to determine whether the player wins or loses. If the player's guess is within ten of the "AI Pitcher"'s RNG, the player "wins"
    Part two consists of:
-designing a form that allows the player to submit a hitting number and start the game
    (after initial testing, I realized I also needed a way to make it so the player COULD NOT edit the pitching number or the result)
-creating a random number generator to supply the second half of the equation, the pitcher's number.
-displaying how each ending result corresponds to a specific baseball play (Home Run, Single are wins, Flyout and Strikeout are losses)
-carrying out a sequence of events that let the player know if they won or lost, including
    --updating the scoreboard to reflect the end of the game
    --animations to show the 'baseball play' happening on a field mock-up
    --a way to restart the game after play has concluded.
    When each individual piece of the project is completed, the expectation is the final product will be worthy of a place in a future portfolio. However, it is also important to point out that this project can continuously be improved, with future updates potentially including deeper CSS customization and potentially even adding more at-bats to the game.
